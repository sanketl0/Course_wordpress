You broke my heart!"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Why did you go to the police? Why didn\u2019t you come to me first? My father taught me many things here \u2013 he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. What\u2019s the matter with you? Is this what you\u2019ve become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? \u201cOh, what do I do? What do I do?\u201d What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn\u2019t she beautiful?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sonny, please don\u2019t do anything. Please don\u2019t do anything. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. I\u2019m gonna make him an offer he can\u2019t refuse. Hey, listen, I want somebody good \u2013 and I mean very good \u2013 to plant that gun. I don\u2019t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? I don\u2019t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can act like a man! If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? My father\u2019s name was Antonio Andolini\u2026 and this is for you. It\u2019s a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? It\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s business. What\u2019s wrong with being a lawyer? I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let\u2019s work through where we go from here. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I\u2019ve always been loyal to you. When they come\u2026 they come at what you love. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet.
