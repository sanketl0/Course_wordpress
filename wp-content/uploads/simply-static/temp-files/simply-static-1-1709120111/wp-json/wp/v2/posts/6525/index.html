Do me this favor. I won\u2019t forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They\u2019ll tell you I know how to return a favor. I don\u2019t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. What\u2019s the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he\u2019s born? I\u2019m your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! What\u2019s the matter with you? Is this what you\u2019ve become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? \u201cOh, what do I do? What do I do?\u201d What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, listen, I want somebody good \u2013 and I mean very good \u2013 to plant that gun. I don\u2019t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? Fredo, you\u2019re my older brother, and I love you. But don\u2019t ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I\u2019ve always been loyal to you. Only don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. I don\u2019t like violence, Tom. I\u2019m a businessman; blood is a big expense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let\u2019s work through where we go from here. It\u2019s an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. When they come\u2026 they come at what you love. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father\u2019s name? Friends and money \u2013 oil and water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My father taught me many things here \u2013 he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet.
