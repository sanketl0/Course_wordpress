My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Why did you go to the police? Why didn&#8217;t you come to me first? Only don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. My father&#8217;s name was Antonio Andolini\u2026 and this is for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Friends and money &#8211; oil and water. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I&#8217;ve always been loyal to you. Sonny, please don&#8217;t do anything. Please don&#8217;t do anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Don&#8217;t ever give an order like that again. Not while I&#8217;m alive. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. I don&#8217;t like violence, Tom. I&#8217;m a businessman; blood is a big expense. I&#8217;m gonna make him an offer he can&#8217;t refuse. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don&#8217;t you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I don&#8217;t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Hey, listen, I want somebody good &#8211; and I mean very good &#8211; to plant that gun. I don&#8217;t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet.
