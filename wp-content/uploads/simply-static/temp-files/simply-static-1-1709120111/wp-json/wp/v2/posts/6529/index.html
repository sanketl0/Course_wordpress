My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Why did you go to the police? Why didn\u2019t you come to me first? Only don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. My father\u2019s name was Antonio Andolini\u2026 and this is for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Friends and money \u2013 oil and water. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I\u2019ve always been loyal to you. Sonny, please don\u2019t do anything. Please don\u2019t do anything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Don\u2019t ever give an order like that again. Not while I\u2019m alive. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. I don\u2019t like violence, Tom. I\u2019m a businessman; blood is a big expense. I\u2019m gonna make him an offer he can\u2019t refuse. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don\u2019t you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I don\u2019t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Hey, listen, I want somebody good \u2013 and I mean very good \u2013 to plant that gun. I don\u2019t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet.
