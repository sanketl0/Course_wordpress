Do me this favor. I won&#8217;t forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They&#8217;ll tell you I know how to return a favor. I don&#8217;t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. What&#8217;s the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he&#8217;s born? I&#8217;m your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! What&#8217;s the matter with you? Is this what you&#8217;ve become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? &#8220;Oh, what do I do? What do I do?&#8221; What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, listen, I want somebody good &#8211; and I mean very good &#8211; to plant that gun. I don&#8217;t want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? Fredo, you&#8217;re my older brother, and I love you. But don&#8217;t ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I&#8217;ve always been loyal to you. Only don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. I don&#8217;t like violence, Tom. I&#8217;m a businessman; blood is a big expense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let&#8217;s work through where we go from here. It&#8217;s an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. When they come\u2026 they come at what you love. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father&#8217;s name? Friends and money &#8211; oil and water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My father taught me many things here &#8211; he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet.
