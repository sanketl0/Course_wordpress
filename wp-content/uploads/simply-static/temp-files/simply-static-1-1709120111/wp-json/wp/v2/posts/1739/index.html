It&#8217;s a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? Do me this favor. I won&#8217;t forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They&#8217;ll tell you I know how to return a favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not personal. It&#8217;s business. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! Te salut, Don Corleone. Fredo, you&#8217;re my older brother, and I love you. But don&#8217;t ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don&#8217;t you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn&#8217;t she beautiful? You can act like a man! Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. I see you took the name of the town. What was your father&#8217;s name? What&#8217;s the matter with you? Is this what you&#8217;ve become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? &#8220;Oh, what do I do? What do I do?&#8221; What is that nonsense? Ridiculous!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Don&#8217;t you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Why do you hurt me, Michael? I&#8217;ve always been loyal to you. What&#8217;s wrong with being a lawyer?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Friends and money &#8211; oil and water. I don&#8217;t feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Never let anyone know what you are thinking.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. It&#8217;s a Sicilian message.
